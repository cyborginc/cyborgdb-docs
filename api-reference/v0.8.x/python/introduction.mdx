<Note>Cyborg Vector Search was renamed to CyborgDB in `v0.9.0`. This version of the docs will refer to the project as Cyborg Vector Search.</Note>

The `CyborgVectorSearch` classes (`Client` and `EncryptedIndex`) provides an interface to initialize, train, and efficiently query encrypted vector indexes in Cyborg Vector Search. It allows creating different vector index types (such as `ivf`, `ivfpq`, `ivfflat`), with configurable distance metrics and device options.

### Key Features

- **Vector Indexing**: Create, load, and manage vector indexes.
- **Encrypted Search**: Provides encrypted Approximate Nearest Neighbor (ANN) search capabilities.
- **Hardware Acceleration**: Option to configure CPU and GPU acceleration.
- **Flexible Data Input**: Accepts data in both `numpy` and `list` formats for embeddings and IDs.

This API is also available in [C++](../cpp/).
