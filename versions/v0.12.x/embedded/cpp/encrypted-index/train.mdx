title: "Train Index"
mode: "wide"
---

Builds the index using the specified training configuration. Required before efficient querying.
Prior to calling this, all queries will be conducted using encrypted exhaustive search.
After, they will be conducted using encrypted ANN search.

```cpp
void TrainIndex(const size_t n_lists = 0, 
                const TrainingConfig& training_config = TrainingConfig());
```

### Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|----------|------------|--------------------|
| `n_lists` | `size_t` | _(Optional)_ Number of inverted index lists to create in the index (will auto-determine if not provided). |
| `training_config` | [`TrainingConfig`](../types#trainingconfig) | _(Optional)_ Training parameters (batch size, max iterations, etc.). |

<Tip>There must be at least `2 * n_lists` or `10,000` (whichever is greater) vector embeddings in the index prior to to calling this function.</Tip>

### Exceptions

Throws if there are not enough vector embeddings in the index for training (must be at least `2 * n_lists`).
