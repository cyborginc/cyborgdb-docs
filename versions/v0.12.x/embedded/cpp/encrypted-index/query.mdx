Retrieves the nearest neighbors for given query vectors.

```cpp
QueryResults Query(Array2D<float>& query_vectors,
                   const QueryParams& query_params = QueryParams());
```

### Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|-------------------|--------------------|-----------------------|
| `query_vectors` | [`Array2D<float>`](../types#array2d) | Query vectors to search. |
| `query_params` | [`QueryParams`](../types#queryparams) | _(Optional)_ Parameters for querying, such as `top_k` and `n_probes`. |

<Tip> If this function is called on an index where `TrainIndex()` has not been executed, the query will use encrypted exhaustive search.
This may cause queries to be slower, especially when there are many vector embeddings in the index.</Tip>

### Returns

[`QueryResults`](#queryresults): Results `top_k` containing decrypted nearest neighbors IDs and distances.

### Exceptions

<AccordionGroup>
    <Accordion title="std::invalid_argument">
        - Throws if the query vectors have incompatible dimensions with the index.
        - Throws if the index was not created or loaded yet.
    </Accordion>
    <Accordion title="std::runtime_exception">
        - Throws if the query could not be executed.
    </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Example Usage

```cpp
cyborg::Array2D<float> queries{/*...*/}; // Populate with one or more query vectors
cyborg::QueryParams params(10, 5);  // top_k = 10, n_probes = 5

QueryResults results = index->Query(queries, params);
std::cout << "ID: " << result.ids[j] << ", Distance: " << result.distances[j] << std::endl;
// Process query results...
```
