CyborgDB Embedded provides native libraries for Python and C++, enabling you to integrate confidential vector search directly into your applications. This deployment model gives you maximum control, performance, and security by running entirely within your infrastructure.

## Why Choose CyborgDB Embedded?

**Maximum Security**  
Your data never leaves your environment. Vector embeddings remain encrypted on your hardware with keys under your complete control.

**Ultimate Performance**  
Direct integration eliminates network overhead and serialization costs. Take advantage of local CPU/GPU resources and custom optimizations.

**Full Control**  
Configure every aspect of the system - from index parameters to memory management. Perfect for custom requirements and specialized deployments.

**Any Environment**  
Deploy in air-gapped networks, edge devices, or custom infrastructure where external APIs aren't suitable.

## Architecture Overview

CyborgDB Embedded integrates directly into your application process:

```mermaid
flowchart TB
  subgraph Your_Applications [Your Application]
    Library("CyborgDB Library (Python/C++)")
  end

  Library --> PostgreSQL("PostgreSQL (local or managed)")
  Library --> Redis("Redis (local or managed)")
  Library --> Memory("Memory (for development)")
```

**Key Benefits:**
- No external API dependencies
- Sub-millisecond query latency potential
- Complete data sovereignty
- Custom integration possibilities

## When to Use Embedded vs Service

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Choose CyborgDB Embedded">
    - **Data must stay on-premises** - Regulatory or security requirements
    - **Ultra-low latency needed** - Sub-millisecond response requirements  
    - **Custom integration required** - Unique workflow or system requirements
    - **Cost optimization critical** - High-volume usage with cost sensitivity
    - **Air-gapped deployment** - No external network access available
    - **Single application focus** - One primary application using vector search
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Consider CyborgDB Service">
    - **Multi-language teams** - Need SDKs in multiple languages
    - **Microservice architecture** - Want to separate vector operations from application logic
    - **Operational simplicity** - Prefer service-based deployment patterns
    - **Independent scaling** - Need to scale vector operations separately
    - **Team collaboration** - Multiple teams need access to the same vector data
  </Tab>
</Tabs>
