Deletes vectors from the encrypted index by their IDs.

```typescript
async delete(ids: string[]): Promise<object>
```

### Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| `ids` | `string[]` | Array of vector IDs to delete from the index |

### Returns

`Promise<object>`: A Promise that resolves to a response object containing the operation status and message with details about the deletion.

### Exceptions

<AccordionGroup>
    <Accordion title="Error">
        - Throws if the API request fails due to network connectivity issues.
        - Throws if authentication fails (invalid API key).
        - Throws if the encryption key is invalid for the specified index.
        - Throws if there are internal server errors preventing the deletion.
    </Accordion>
    <Accordion title="Validation Errors">
        - Throws if the `ids` parameter is null, undefined, or empty.
        - Throws if any of the provided IDs are invalid format.
    </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Example Usage

```typescript
import { Client } from 'cyborgdb';

const client = new Client('http://localhost:8000', 'your-api-key');

// Load an existing index
const indexKey = new Uint8Array(Buffer.from('your-stored-hex-key', 'hex'));
const index = await client.loadIndex('my-vector-index', indexKey);

// Add some vectors first
await index.upsert([
    { id: 'doc1', vector: [0.1, 0.2, 0.3], metadata: { title: 'Document 1' } },
    { id: 'doc2', vector: [0.4, 0.5, 0.6], metadata: { title: 'Document 2' } },
    { id: 'doc3', vector: [0.7, 0.8, 0.9], metadata: { title: 'Document 3' } }
]);

// Delete specific vectors
try {
    const result = await index.delete(['doc1', 'doc2']);
    console.log('Deletion result:', result);
    // Typical output: { status: 'success', message: 'Deleted 2 vectors', deleted_count: 2 }
    
    // Verify deletion by trying to retrieve
    const remaining = await index.get(['doc1', 'doc2', 'doc3']);
    console.log(`Remaining vectors: ${remaining.length}`); // Should be 1 (only doc3)
    
} catch (error) {
    console.error('Failed to delete vectors:', error.message);
}
```

### Response Format

The method returns a response object with the following structure:

```typescript
// Standard successful deletion response
{
    "status": "success",
    "message": "Successfully deleted 3 vectors",
    // Additional fields may be present depending on implementation
}
```

### Best Practices

- **Verify Before Delete**: Check vector existence before deletion to avoid errors
- **Batch Operations**: Delete multiple vectors in single calls for efficiency
- **Error Handling**: Implement robust error handling for network failures
- **Backup Strategy**: Consider backing up important vectors before deletion
- **Audit Trail**: Log deletion operations for compliance and debugging
- **Transaction Safety**: Be aware that deletions are immediate and cannot be undone
