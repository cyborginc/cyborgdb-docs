mode: "wide"

<Warning>This action is irreversible. Proceed with caution.</Warning>

Deletes the current index and all its associated data from the CyborgDB service.

```typescript
async deleteIndex(): Promise<object>
```

### Returns

`Promise<object>`: A Promise that resolves to a response object containing the operation status and message. The method gracefully handles cases where the index was already deleted.

### Exceptions

<AccordionGroup>
    <Accordion title="Error">
        - Throws if the API request fails due to network connectivity issues.
        - Throws if authentication fails (invalid API key).
        - Throws if there are internal server errors preventing the deletion.
    </Accordion>
    <Accordion title="Index Errors">
        - Returns success status if the index was already deleted or doesn't exist.
        - Throws if the encryption key is invalid for the specified index (unless already deleted).
    </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Example Usage

```typescript
import { Client } from 'cyborgdb';

const client = new Client('http://localhost:8000', 'your-api-key');

// Load an existing index
const indexKey = new Uint8Array(Buffer.from('your-stored-hex-key', 'hex'));
const index = await client.loadIndex('temporary-index', indexKey);

// Delete the index when no longer needed
try {
    const result = await index.deleteIndex();
    console.log('Index deletion result:', result);
    // Possible outputs:
    // { status: 'success', message: "Index 'temporary-index' deleted successfully" }
    // { status: 'success', message: "Index 'temporary-index' was already deleted" }
    
} catch (error) {
    console.error('Failed to delete index:', error.message);
}
```

### Response Format

The method returns a response object with the following structure:

```typescript
// Standard successful deletion response
{
    "status": "success",
    "message": "Index 'my-index' deleted successfully"
}

// When index was already deleted (handled gracefully)
{
    "status": "success", 
    "message": "Index 'my-index' was already deleted"
}
```

### Best Practices

- **Confirmation**: Always implement user confirmation for deletion operations in production applications
- **Backup Strategy**: Consider exporting important data before deletion if needed for recovery
- **Cleanup References**: Remove local references to deleted indexes to prevent memory leaks
- **Error Handling**: Implement proper error handling to gracefully handle network failures
- **Audit Logging**: Log deletion operations for audit trails and debugging
- **Batch Operations**: When deleting multiple indexes, handle failures gracefully to avoid partial cleanup states
- **Verification**: Verify index name before deletion to prevent accidental deletions

### Important Notes

- Once deleted, the index and all its data cannot be recovered
- The operation affects all vectors, metadata, and configuration associated with the index
- Other applications or services using the same index will lose access immediately
- The deletion is performed on the CyborgDB service and cannot be undone
- The method gracefully handles already-deleted indexes without throwing errors
