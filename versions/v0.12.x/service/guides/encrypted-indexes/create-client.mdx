The `Client` class provides an interface to connect to the CyborgDB service and manage encrypted indexes. It allows you to create, list, and interact with encrypted indexes through the CyborgDB REST API.

## Creating the Client

To create the client, you need to provide the service URL and optionally an API key for authentication:

<CodeGroup>
```python Python SDK icon="python"
from cyborgdb import Client

# Create client with API key (for production)
client = Client('http://localhost:8000', 'your-api-key')

# Create client without API key (for local development)
local_client = Client('http://localhost:8000', None)
```

```javascript JavaScript SDK icon="js"
import { Client } from 'cyborgdb';

// Create client with API key (for production) 
const client = new Client('http://localhost:8000', 'your-api-key');

// Create client without API key (for local development)
const localClient = new Client('http://localhost:8000');
```

```typescript TypeScript SDK icon="code"
import { Client } from 'cyborgdb';

// Create client with API key (for production)
const client = new Client('http://localhost:8000', 'your-api-key');

// Create client without API key (for local development)
const localClient = new Client('http://localhost:8000');
```

```go Go SDK icon="golang"
// TODO
```

```bash cURL icon="rectangle-terminal"
# Test connection with health check
curl -X GET "http://localhost:8000/v1/health"

# All subsequent API calls will use this pattern:
# curl -H "X-API-Key: your-api-key" "http://localhost:8000/v1/..."
```
</CodeGroup>

<Tip>If using the REST API directly, you don't need to create a client. You can make HTTP requests directly to the [service endpoints](../../rest-api/introduction).</Tip>

## API Key Authentication

For production deployments, you'll need an API key for authentication. You can get an API key from the [CyborgDB Admin Dashboard](https://cyborgdb.co).

The client handles all authentication automatically once you provide the API key during initialization.

## Service Connection

The client connects to the CyborgDB service via HTTP/HTTPS. All data transmission is secured, and all index data is end-to-end encrypted before being sent to the service.

- **Local Development**: Use `http://localhost:8000` without an API key when running the service locally
- **Production**: Use your hosted service URL with an API key for authentication

## Health Checking

You can verify the service connection and health:

<CodeGroup>
```python Python SDK icon="python"
# Check service health
try:
    health = client.get_health()
    print("Service status:", health["status"])
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Service unavailable: {e}")
```

```javascript JavaScript SDK icon="js"
// Check service health
try {
    const health = await client.getHealth();
    console.log('Service status:', health);
} catch (error) {
    console.error('Service unavailable:', error.message);
}
```

```typescript TypeScript SDK icon="code"
// Check service health
try {
    const health = await client.getHealth();
    console.log('Service status:', health);
} catch (error) {
    console.error('Service unavailable:', error.message);
}
```

```go Go SDK icon="golang"
// TODO
```

```bash cURL icon="rectangle-terminal"
# Check service health (no API key required)
curl -X GET "http://localhost:8000/v1/health"

# Expected response:
# {"status": "healthy", "timestamp": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z"}
```
