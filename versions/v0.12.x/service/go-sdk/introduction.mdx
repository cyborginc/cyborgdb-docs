The **CyborgDB** Go SDK provides a strongly-typed interface for securely interacting with encrypted indexes. It supports all core operations including index creation, data insertion, and encrypted querying.

The package is available on GitHub at [github.com/cyborginc/cyborgdb-go](https://github.com/cyborginc/cyborgdb-go).

## Installation

```bash
go get github.com/cyborginc/cyborgdb-go
```

## Prerequisites

Before using the CyborgDB Go SDK, you need to have the CyborgDB service running:

```bash
# Install the CyborgDB service
pip install cyborgdb-service

# Or pull the Docker image
docker pull cyborginc/cyborgdb-service

# Start the service
cyborgdb-service

# Or run the Docker container
docker run -p 8000:8000 cyborginc/cyborgdb-service
```
