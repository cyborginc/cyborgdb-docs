The **CyborgDB** Go SDK provides a high-level interface for working with encrypted indexes in Go applications. It supports core operations such as creating indexes, adding data, querying, and managing metadata.

The package is available on [pkg.go.dev](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/cyborginc/cyborgdb-go).

## Installation

```bash
go get github.com/cyborginc/cyborgdb-go
```

## Prerequisites

Before using the CyborgDB Go SDK, you need to have the CyborgDB service running:

```bash
# Install the CyborgDB service
pip install cyborgdb-service

# Or pull the Docker image
docker pull cyborginc/cyborgdb-service

# Start the service
cyborgdb-service

# Or run the Docker container
docker run -p 8000:8000 cyborginc/cyborgdb-service
```
