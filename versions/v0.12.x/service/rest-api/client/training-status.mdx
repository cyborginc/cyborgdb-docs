Get the current training status including indexes being trained and the retrain threshold configuration.

## Authentication

Required - API key via `X-API-Key` header:

```http
X-API-Key: cyborg_your_api_key_here
```

You can get an API key from the [CyborgDB Admin Dashboard](https://cyborgdb.co). For more info, follow [this guide](../../../intro/get-api-key).

## Request

This is a GET request with no request body. Authentication is required via the API key header.

## Response

```json
{
  "training_indexes": ["my_index", "semantic_index"],
  "retrain_threshold": 10,
  "worker_pid": 12345,
  "global_training": {

      "status": "in_progress",
      "started_at": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z",
      "progress": 0.75
    },
    "semantic_index": {

<Expandable title="response fields">
  <ResponseField name="training_indexes" type="array[string]">
    List of index names currently being trained or queued for training
  </ResponseField>
  <ResponseField name="retrain_threshold" type="integer">
    The multiplier used for the retraining threshold. When the number of vectors exceeds (initial_vectors * retrain_threshold), automatic retraining is triggered
  </ResponseField>
  <ResponseField name="worker_pid" type="integer">

## Training States

The `global_training` object contains detailed status for each index:

- **`queued`**: Index is waiting in the training queue
- **`in_progress`**: Index is currently being trained
- **`completed`**: Training finished successfully
- **`failed`**: Training encountered an error

## Exceptions

- `401`: Authentication failed (invalid API key)
- `500`: Internal server error

## Example Usage

**Get Training Status:**
```bash
curl -X GET "http://localhost:8000/v1/indexes/training-status" \
     -H "X-API-Key: cyborg_your_api_key_here"
```

**Monitor Training Progress:**
```bash
# Check if any indexes are being trained
training_count=$(curl -s -X GET "http://localhost:8000/v1/indexes/training-status" \
     -H "X-API-Key: cyborg_your_api_key_here" | \
     jq '.training_indexes | length')

if [ "$training_count" -gt 0 ]; then
    echo "$training_count indexes are currently being trained"
fi
```

**Wait for Training Completion:**
```bash
# Poll until specific index training is complete
index_name="my_index"

while true; do
    is_training=$(curl -s -X GET "http://localhost:8000/v1/indexes/training-status" \
         -H "X-API-Key: cyborg_your_api_key_here" | \
         jq --arg idx "$index_name" '.training_indexes | contains([$idx])')
    
    if [ "$is_training" = "false" ]; then
        echo "Training complete for $index_name"
        break
    fi
    
    echo "Still training $index_name..."
    sleep 5
done
```

**Check Retrain Threshold:**
```bash
# Get the current retrain threshold
threshold=$(curl -s -X GET "http://localhost:8000/v1/indexes/training-status" \
     -H "X-API-Key: cyborg_your_api_key_here" | \
     jq '.retrain_threshold')

echo "Indexes will retrain when vector count exceeds ${threshold}x the initial training size"
```

<Note>
Training is automatically triggered when:
1. An index reaches the configured vector threshold (initial_vectors * retrain_threshold)
2. Manual training is requested via the `/v1/indexes/train` endpoint
3. The index has never been trained and reaches the minimum vector count
</Note>

<Tip>Use this endpoint to avoid querying an index while it's being trained, as training can temporarily affect query performance.</Tip>
