<Note>This function is only present in the [embedded library](../../../guides/get-started/about#deployment-models) version of Cyborg Vector Search.
In other versions (microservice, serverless), it is automatically called once enough vector embeddings have been indexed.</Note>

Builds the index using the specified training configuration. Required before efficient querying.
Prior to calling this, all queries will be conducted using encrypted exhaustive search.
After, they will be conducted using encrypted ANN search.

```python
def train(self, batch_size: int = 2048, max_iters: int = 100, tolerance: float = 1e-6)
```

### Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
|---------------|--------|---------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| `batch_size` | `int` | `2048` | _(Optional)_ Size of each batch for training. |
| `max_iters` | `int` | `100` | _(Optional)_ Maximum number of iterations for training. |
| `tolerance` | `float`| `1e-6` | _(Optional)_ Convergence tolerance for training. |

<Tip>There must be at least `2 * n_lists` vector embeddings in the index prior to to calling this function.</Tip>

### Exceptions

<AccordionGroup>
    <Accordion title="ValueError">
        - Raises an exception if the index was not created or loaded yet.
    </Accordion>
    <Accordion title="RuntimeError">
        - Raises an exception if there are not enough vector embeddings in the index for training (must be at least `2 * n_lists`).
        - Raises an exception if the index could not be trained.
    </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Example Usage

```python
# Load index
index = client.load_index(index_name=index_name, index_key=index_key)

# Train the index with custom settings
index.train(batch_size=128, max_iters=10, tolerance=1e-4)

# Train with default settings (auto-selected configuration)
index.train()
```
