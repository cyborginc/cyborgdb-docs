**Cyborg Vector Search** is the first Confidential Vector DB:

- Introduces a novel architecture to keep confidential inference data secure through **zero-trust design**.
- Keeps vector embeddings **end-to-end encrypted** throughout their lifecycle (including at search time).
- Exposes a familiar API, making it **easy to integrate** with existing AI workflows.
- Provides **high-performance indexing and retrieval** which can be [GPU-accelerated with CUDA](https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/bringing-confidentiality-to-vector-search-with-cyborg-and-nvidia-cuvs/).
- Works with DBs such as Postgres and Redis, **transforming traditional DBs into Confidential Vector DBs**.
