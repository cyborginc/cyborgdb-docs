## Step-by-Step Guide

<Steps>
  <Step title="Sign Up for CyborgDB">
    Visit [cyborgdb.co](https://cyborgdb.co) and create your account.
    
    1. Click **"Sign Up"** in the top navigation
    2. Enter your email address and create a secure password
    3. Verify your email address by clicking the link sent to your inbox
    4. Complete your profile setup
    
    <Note>
    Your account starts with access to free API keys by default.
    </Note>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Choose Your Plan (Optional)">
    If you need production capabilities, upgrade to a paid plan.
    
    1. Navigate to the **"Billing"** section in your dashboard
    2. Review the available plans and features
    3. Select the plan that best fits your needs
    4. Complete the payment setup
    
    <Warning>
    **Plan Disclosure**: Paid plans unlock `cyborgdb-core` with unlimited vectors, GPU acceleration, and all backing stores. Free plans use `cyborgdb-lite` with usage limitations. You can always start free and upgrade later.
    </Warning>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Generate Your API Key">
    Create a new API key from your dashboard.
    
    1. In your CyborgDB dashboard, locate the **"API Keys"** section
    2. Click the **"Add"** button next to "API Keys"

    <Warning>
    **Important**: Copy your API key immediately and store it securely. For security reasons, you won't be able to see the full key again after leaving this page.
    </Warning>
    
    **Best Practices:**
    - Store your API key in environment variables, not in your code
    - Never commit API keys to version control
    - Use different keys for development and production environments
    - Rotate keys regularly for enhanced security
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Using Your API Key

Once you have your API key, you can use it with any CyborgDB deployment:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Environment Variable (Recommended)">
    Set your API key as an environment variable:
    
    ```bash
    export CYBORGDB_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"
    ```
    
    Then reference it in your code:
    
    ```python
    import os
    from cyborgdb_core import Client
    
    client = Client(api_key=os.getenv("CYBORGDB_API_KEY"))
    ```
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Direct Usage">
    Use your API key directly in your code (not recommended for production):
    
    ```python
    from cyborgdb_core import Client
    
    client = Client(api_key="your-api-key-here")
    ```
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Configuration File">
    Store in a configuration file that's excluded from version control:
    
    ```python
    # config.py (add to .gitignore)
    CYBORGDB_API_KEY = "your-api-key-here"
    
    # main.py
    from config import CYBORGDB_API_KEY
    from cyborgdb_core import Client
    
    client = Client(api_key=CYBORGDB_API_KEY)
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>
