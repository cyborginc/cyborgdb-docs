CyborgDB’s security model assumes that **attackers may gain direct access to the vector database**. This could be via:

* Exploiting vulnerabilities in the application layer
* Insider threats with elevated permissions
* Misconfigured or exposed cloud resources

Once inside a standard vector DB, an attacker could:

<Steps>
    <Step title="Exfiltrate Embeddings" icon="download">
        Extract & download dense vector data from the database.
    </Step>
    <Step title="Run Inversion Attacks" icon="forward">
        Use public or custom ML models to reconstruct original text or images from embeddings.
    </Step>
    <Step title="Recover Sensitive Data" icon="lock-open">
        Expose information from Finance, HR, CRM, and other systems.
    </Step>
</Steps>

We’ve seen similar high-impact breaches with open Elasticsearch clusters and misconfigured S3 buckets  -  but in those cases, attackers only got data from one system. A vector DB breach could expose data from  every system it’s connected to - amplifying the impact far beyond a single application.

## Attack Demo

Cyborg showcased such an attack on a popular vector database at the Confidential Computing Summit in June 2025. You can watch the attack demo below:

## How CyborgDB Disrupts the Attack Chain

* **[In-use encryption](./encryption)** ensures embeddings are never in plaintext - even in memory.
* **Key isolation (BYOK/HYOK)** ensures encryption keys are controlled by the customer, not Cyborg or the cloud provider.
* **Full audit logging** makes suspicious access patterns visible.

By protecting data across its full lifecycle and designing for zero-plaintext exposure, CyborgDB minimizes the blast radius of any compromise.

We assume the attacker will get inside. Our job is to make sure they leave with nothing useful.
