Trains the encrypted index to optimize it for efficient similarity search queries. Training is essential for IVF-based indexes to achieve optimal query performance and accuracy.

```typescript
async train(
    batchSize: number = 2048,
    maxIters: number = 100,
    tolerance: number = 1e-6
): Promise<CyborgdbServiceApiSchemasIndexSuccessResponseModel>
```

### Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
|-----------|------|---------|-------------|
| `batchSize` | `number` | `2048` | _(Optional)_ Size of each batch processed during training. Larger values may improve training quality but use more memory |
| `maxIters` | `number` | `100` | _(Optional)_ Maximum number of iterations for the training algorithm. More iterations may improve accuracy but take longer |
| `tolerance` | `number` | `1e-6` | _(Optional)_ Convergence tolerance for training. Smaller values result in more precise training but may take longer |

<Note>Training is a compute-intensive operation that may take several seconds to minutes depending on the index size and configuration.</Note>

### Returns

`Promise<CyborgdbServiceApiSchemasIndexSuccessResponseModel>`: A Promise that resolves to a success response object containing the operation status and training completion message.

### Example Usage

#### Basic Index Training

```typescript
import { Client, IndexIVFModel } from '@cyborgdb/sdk-js-ts';

const client = new Client('https://your-cyborgdb-service.com', 'your-api-key');

// Create and populate index
const indexKey = crypto.getRandomValues(new Uint8Array(32));
const config: IndexIVFModel = {
    type: 'ivf',
    dimension: 768,
    nLists: 1024,
    metric: 'cosine'
};

const index = await client.createIndex('my-vectors', indexKey, config);

// Add vectors to the index
await index.upsert([
    { id: 'doc1', vector: [0.1, 0.2, 0.3, /* ... 768 dimensions */], metadata: { title: 'Document 1' } },
    { id: 'doc2', vector: [0.4, 0.5, 0.6, /* ... 768 dimensions */], metadata: { title: 'Document 2' } },
    { id: 'doc3', vector: [0.7, 0.8, 0.9, /* ... 768 dimensions */], metadata: { title: 'Document 3' } }
]);

// Train the index with default parameters
try {
    console.log('Starting index training...');
    const startTime = Date.now();
    
    const result = await index.train();
    
    const duration = Date.now() - startTime;
    console.log(`Training completed in ${duration}ms`);
    console.log('Training result:', result.message);
    // Output: "Index 'my-vectors' trained successfully"
    
    // Index is now optimized for queries
    const queryResults = await index.query([0.1, 0.2, 0.3, /* ... */], 5);
    console.log('Query after training:', queryResults);
    
} catch (error) {
    console.error('Training failed:', error.message);
}
```

#### Custom Training Parameters

```typescript
// High-quality training with custom parameters
async function trainHighQuality(index: EncryptedIndex) {
    try {
        const result = await index.train(
            4096,    // batchSize: larger batches for better quality
            200,     // maxIters: more iterations for convergence
            1e-8     // tolerance: stricter convergence criteria
        );
        
        console.log('High-quality training completed:', result.message);
        return result;
        
    } catch (error) {
        console.error('High-quality training failed:', error.message);
        throw error;
    }
}

// Fast training with relaxed parameters
async function trainFast(index: EncryptedIndex) {
    try {
        const result = await index.train(
            1024,    // batchSize: smaller batches for speed
            50,      // maxIters: fewer iterations for speed
            1e-4     // tolerance: relaxed convergence for speed
        );
        
        console.log('Fast training completed:', result.message);
        return result;
        
    } catch (error) {
        console.error('Fast training failed:', error.message);
        throw error;
    }
}

// Usage based on requirements
if (requiresHighAccuracy) {
    await trainHighQuality(index);
} else {
    await trainFast(index);
}
```

### Response Format

The method returns a success response object with the following structure:

```typescript
// Standard training completion response
{
    "status": "success",
    "message": "Index 'my-vectors' trained successfully"
}
```

#### Response Fields

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `status` | `string` | Operation status (typically "success") |
| `message` | `string` | Descriptive message about the training completion |

### When to Train

Training is required in the following scenarios:

- **After Index Creation**: New indexes need training before efficient querying
- **After Bulk Data Addition**: When adding large amounts of new data
- **Performance Degradation**: When query performance noticeably decreases
- **Index Modifications**: After significant changes to the vector dataset

### Performance Considerations

#### Parameter Selection

- **Small datasets (< 1,000 vectors)**: Use default parameters or smaller batch sizes
- **Medium datasets (1,000-10,000 vectors)**: Use default parameters
- **Large datasets (> 10,000 vectors)**: Consider larger batch sizes and more iterations

#### Index Type Impact

- **IVF**: Requires training for optimal performance
- **IVFFlat**: Benefits significantly from training
- **IVFPQ**: May require more iterations due to quantization complexity

#### Memory Considerations

- Larger batch sizes use more memory but may improve training quality
- Monitor memory usage during training of very large indexes
- Consider training in off-peak hours for production systems

### Best Practices

- **Train After Data Loading**: Always train after adding significant amounts of data
- **Monitor Training Time**: Set appropriate timeouts for training operations
- **Parameter Tuning**: Adjust parameters based on your accuracy vs speed requirements
- **Progress Monitoring**: Implement progress tracking for long-running training operations
- **Error Handling**: Implement retry logic with progressive parameter relaxation
- **Testing**: Verify query performance after training completion
- **Documentation**: Document optimal training parameters for your specific use case

### Important Notes

- Training is a blocking operation that may take significant time
- The index remains queryable during training but with potentially suboptimal performance
- Training parameters significantly affect both training time and resulting query performance
- Larger datasets generally benefit from larger batch sizes and more iterations
- Training failure doesn't corrupt the index - you can retry with different parameters
