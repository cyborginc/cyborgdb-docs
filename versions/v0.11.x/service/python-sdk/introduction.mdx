The **CyborgDB** Python SDK provides a high-level interface for working with encrypted indexes in Python applications. It supports core operations such as creating indexes, adding data, querying, and managing metadata. The SDK is compatible with LangChain and works with both local and remote deployments.

The package is available on PyPI.

## Installation

```Python
pip install cyborgdb
```

## Prerequisites

Before using the CyborgDB Python SDK, you need to have the CyborgDB service running:

```Python
# Install the CyborgDB service
pip install cyborgdb-service

# Start the service
cyborgdb-service
```

For detailed service setup instructions, see our quickstart guides for [Docker](../../guides/quickstart/docker-service) and [python](../../guides/quickstart/python-service).
