<Warning>
This method is not currently implemented in the Python SDK. The health check endpoint exists in the CyborgDB service API, but the Python client does not expose a `get_health()` method.

To check service health, you can make a direct HTTP request to the `/v1/health` endpoint or use the JavaScript/TypeScript SDK which includes this functionality.

This will be fixed in the `v0.12.0` release of the Python SDK.
</Warning>

Checks the health status of the CyborgDB microservice to verify connectivity and service availability.

```python
def get_health() -> Dict[str, str]
```

### Returns

`Dict[str, str]`: Health status information from the service.

### Exceptions

<AccordionGroup>
    <Accordion title="Error">
        - Throws if the health check request fails due to network connectivity issues.
        - Throws if the server is unreachable or times out.
        - Throws if authentication fails (invalid API key).
    </Accordion>
    <Accordion title="Service Errors">
        - Throws if the CyborgDB service is unhealthy or experiencing issues.
        - Throws if there are internal server errors preventing health reporting.
    </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Example Usage

```python
health = client.get_health()
print(f"Service status: {health}")
```
