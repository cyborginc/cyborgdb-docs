<Warning>
The service-based Python SDK does not have a separate `load_index()` method. Instead, use the `create_index()` method to connect to existing indexes.

This will be changed in the `v0.12.0` release of the Python SDK.
</Warning>

## Connecting to Existing Indexes

To connect to an existing index using the service Python SDK, use `create_index()` with the same parameters:

```python
from cyborgdb import Client, IndexIVF

client = Client('http://localhost:3000', 'your-api-key')

# Connect to existing index (or create if it doesn't exist)
index_key = your_existing_32_byte_key  # Must be the same key used originally
config = IndexIVF(
    type='ivf',
    dimension=768,
    n_lists=1024,
    metric='cosine'
)

# This will connect to the existing index if it exists with this name and key
index = client.create_index(
    index_name='my-existing-index',
    index_key=index_key,
    index_config=config
)
```
