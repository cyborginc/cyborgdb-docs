The `Client` class provides an interface to initialize, create, load and list Encrypted Indexes. Encrypted Indexes, in turn, expose data-related functionality such as upserting, querying, and deleting.

## Creating the Client

To create the client, you must define the [backing store locations](../../../intro/backing-stores) which it will use. At minimum, you must set an `index_location` (where the index will reside) and a `config_location` (where the index metadata will reside). For example:

<CodeGroup>
```python Python
# Import cyborgdb_core or cyborgdb_lite:
import cyborgdb_core as cyborgdb
import cyborgdb_lite as cyborgdb
import secrets

# Using `memory` storage for this example
# `redis` and `postgres` are also supported

index_location = cyborgdb.DBConfig("memory")  # Where encrypted index is stored (for queries)
config_location = cyborgdb.DBConfig("memory") # Where encrypted index config is stored (for config/loading)

# Create a client
client = cyborgdb.Client(index_location, config_location)
```

```cpp C++
#include "cyborgdb_core/client.hpp"
#include "cyborgdb_core/encrypted_index.hpp"
#include <array>
#include <random>

// Using `memory` storage for this example
// `redis` and `postgres` are also supported

cyborg::DBConfig index_location(Location::kMemory);  // Where encrypted index is stored (for queries)
cyborg::DBConfig config_location(Location::kMemory); // Where encrypted index config is stored (for config/loading)

// Create a client
cyborg::Client client(index_location, config_location);
```
</CodeGroup>

Bear in mind that all contents stored in the backing stores is end-to-end encrypted, meaning that **no index contents will be stored in plaintext**. For performance reasons, you may wish to use a "fast" backing store option for `index_location`, such as Redis.

## Creating the Client with Item Storage

If you wish to store encrypted items in the index, you will also need to set a `item_location`:

<CodeGroup>
```python Python
# Import cyborgdb_core or cyborgdb_lite:
import cyborgdb_core as cyborgdb
import cyborgdb_lite as cyborgdb

# Using `redis` storage for the index and config
# Using `postgres` storage for the items
index_location = cyborgdb.DBConfig(location="redis", connection_string="redis://localhost")
config_location = cyborgdb.DBConfig(location="redis", connection_string="redis://localhost")
item_location = cyborgdb.DBConfig(location="postgres", table_name="item_table", connection_string="host=localhost dbname=postgres")

# Construct the Client object
client = cyborgdb.Client(index_location=index_location, 
                            config_location=config_location,
                            item_location=item_location)
```

```cpp C++
#include "cyborgdb_core/client.hpp"

// Using `redis` storage for the index and config
// Using `postgres` storage for the items
cyborg::DBConfig index_location(Location::kRedis, "redis://localhost");
cyborg::DBConfig config_location(Location::kRedis, "redis://localhost");
cyborg::DBConfig item_location(Location::kPostgres, "host=localhost dbname=postgres");

// Construct the Client object
cyborg::Client client(index_location, config_location, item_location);
```
</CodeGroup>

Item contents will be encrypted prior to being uploaded to the backing store. In most applications, these are accessed less frequently than the index, so a "slower" backing store option can be used, such as PostgreSQL.

## Setting Device Configurations

CyborgDB can be accelerated in two ways:

- CPU Multithreading (via `OpenMP`) -> can scale with the number of CPU cores available
- GPU Acceleration (via `CUDA` & `cuVS`) -> can increase the speed of certain operations (e.g., ingestion) by an order of magnitude.

You can control either of these with the optional `cpu_threads` and `gpu_accelerate` flags:

<CodeGroup>
```python Python
# ... existing setup
client = cyborgdb.Client(index_location=index_location, 
                            config_location=config_location,
                            item_location=item_location,
                            cpu_threads=4,
                            gpu_accelerate=False)
```

```cpp C++
// ... existing setup
cyborg::Client client(index_location, config_location, item_location, 4, false);
```
</CodeGroup>

<Info>`gpu_accelerate` can only be set to `True` if running on a CUDA-enabled system with the CUDA driver installed.</Info>

By default, `cpu_threads` will use all available cores, and `gpu_accelerate` will be set to `False`.
