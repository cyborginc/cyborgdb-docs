Encrypted Indexes are the main organizational unit of CyborgDB. One encrypted index is secured with one index key, which provides useful segmentation:

- **Cryptographic isolation**: each index is isolated via encryption keys, making it impossible to query/view the contents of an index without proper access/authorization.
- **Multi-tenancy**: this separation makes it easy to separate data scopes (e.g., tenants) in a robust and secure manner.

One client can manage an arbitary number of indexes, and an index can contain an arbitrary amount of items/vectors. All contents of the index are end-to-end encrypted, meaning that they remain encrypted throughout their lifecycle (at-rest and in-use).
