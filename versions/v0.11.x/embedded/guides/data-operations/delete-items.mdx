You can delete items from an encrypted index using `delete()`:

<CodeGroup>
```python Python icon="python"
index.delete(["item1", "item2"])
```

```cpp C++ icon="brackets-curly"
index->Delete({"item1", "item2"});
```
</CodeGroup>

<Warning>This operation is irreversible. Once you delete an item, you cannot recover it.</Warning>
