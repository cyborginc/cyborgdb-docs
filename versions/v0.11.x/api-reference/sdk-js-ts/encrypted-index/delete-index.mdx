```typescript
async deleteIndex(): Promise<{ status: string; message?: string }>
```

### Parameters

This method takes no parameters.

### Returns

`Promise<CyborgdbServiceApiSchemasIndexSuccessResponseModel>`: A Promise that resolves to a success response object containing the operation status and message.

### Exceptions

<AccordionGroup>
    <Accordion title="Error">
        - Throws if the API request fails due to network connectivity issues.
        - Throws if authentication fails (invalid API key).
        - Throws if there are internal server errors preventing the deletion.
    </Accordion>
    <Accordion title="Index Errors">
        - Returns success status if the index was already deleted or doesn't exist.
        - Throws if the encryption key is invalid for the specified index.
    </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Example Usage

```typescript
import { Client, IndexIVFModel } from '@cyborgdb/sdk-js-ts';

const client = new Client('https://your-cyborgdb-service.com', 'your-api-key');

// Create an index
const indexKey = crypto.getRandomValues(new Uint8Array(32));
const config: IndexIVFModel = {
    type: 'ivf',
    dimension: 768,
    nLists: 1024,
    metric: 'cosine'
};

const index = await client.createIndex('temporary-index', indexKey, config);

// Use the index for operations
await index.upsert([
    { id: '1', vector: [0.1, 0.2, 0.3, ...], metadata: { temp: true } }
]);

// Delete the index when no longer needed
try {
    const result = await index.deleteIndex();
    console.log('Index deleted:', result);
    // Output: { status: 'success', message: "Index 'temporary-index' deleted successfully" }
} catch (error) {
    console.error('Failed to delete index:', error.message);
}
```

### Response Format

The method returns a success response object with the following structure:

```typescript
// Standard successful deletion response
{
    "status": "success",
    "message": "Index 'index-name' deleted successfully"
}

// When index was already deleted (handled gracefully)
{
    "status": "success", 
    "message": "Index 'index-name' was already deleted"
}
```

#### Response Fields

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `status` | `string` | Operation status (defaults to "success") |
| `message` | `string` | Descriptive message about the deletion result |

### Best Practices

- **Confirmation**: Always implement user confirmation for deletion operations in production applications
- **Backup**: Consider exporting important data before deletion if needed for recovery
- **Cleanup**: Remove local references to deleted indexes to prevent memory leaks
- **Error Handling**: Implement proper error handling to gracefully handle network failures
- **Logging**: Log deletion operations for audit trails and debugging
- **Batch Operations**: When deleting multiple indexes, handle failures gracefully to avoid partial cleanup states

### Important Notes

- Once deleted, the index and all its data cannot be recovered
- The operation affects all vectors, metadata, and configuration associated with the index
- Other applications or services using the same index will lose access immediately
- The deletion is performed on the CyborgDB service and cannot be undone
