The C++ API for CyborgDB is split into two main classes within the `cyborg` namespace:

- `Client` – Handles configuration, index creation/loading, and listing available indexes.
- `EncryptedIndex` – Provides data operations on a specific encrypted index such as upserting vectors, training the index, querying, and retrieving stored items.

This API is also exposed via PyBind11 in the [Python API](../python/).
