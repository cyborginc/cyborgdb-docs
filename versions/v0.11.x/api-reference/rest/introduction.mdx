The CyborgDB REST API provides HTTP endpoints for all encrypted vector database operations. The API is organized into two main categories:

- **Index Management** – Handles creation, configuration, training, and deletion of encrypted indexes.
- **Vector Operations** – Provides data operations within indexes such as upserting vectors, querying, and retrieving stored items.

This API is accessible via both [Docker Service](../../guides/quickstart/docker-service) and [Python Service](../../guides/quickstart/python-service) deployment methods.

## Base URL

The API is available at different URLs depending on your setup:

**Development (HTTP):**
```
http://localhost:8000/v1
```

**Production (HTTPS):**
```
https://your-domain.com:8000/v1
```

<Note>HTTPS is automatically enabled when SSL certificates are configured in the service. See the Docker Service or Python Service guides for SSL setup instructions.</Note>

## Authentication

All API endpoints (except `/v1/health`) require authentication via API key in the request header:

```http
X-API-Key: cyborg_your_api_key_here
```

## Error Responses

All endpoints return errors in this format:

```json
{
  "status_code": 400,
  "detail": "Detailed error message describing what went wrong"
}
```

Common status codes:
- `401`: Authentication failed (invalid API key)
- `404`: Index not found
- `409`: Index name conflict
- `422`: Validation error (malformed request)
- `500`: Internal server error
