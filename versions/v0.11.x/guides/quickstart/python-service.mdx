**CyborgDB** can be deployed as a Python service using pip installation. This approach provides a lightweight alternative to Docker, allowing you to run the CyborgDB service directly in your Python environment with full control over dependencies and configuration.

## Overview
The Python service is ideal for developers who prefer managing Python environments directly, need custom dependency management, or want to integrate CyborgDB service into existing Python applications. It provides the same REST API functionality as the Docker version.

<Steps>
    <Step title="Get an API Key">
        To use CyborgDB, you need an API key. You can get one from the [CyborgDB Admin Dashboard](https://cyborgdb.co/).

        Make sure to keep your API key secure and do not share it publicly.
    </Step>

    <Step title="Check Prerequisites">
        Ensure you have the required Python version and environment tools:

        - **Python**: 3.9, 3.10, 3.11, 3.12, or 3.13
        - **Package Manager**: conda (recommended) or pip with virtual environment
        - **Database**: PostgreSQL or Redis instance (local or managed)

        <Note>While conda is mentioned in the build instructions, the wheel works with any Python environment manager including pip, pipenv, poetry, etc.</Note>
    </Step>

    <Step title="Choose Your Database Backend">
        CyborgDB service supports two database backends - choose based on your existing infrastructure:
        
        - **PostgreSQL**: Compatible with your existing PostgreSQL infrastructure
          - Managed services: AWS RDS, Azure Database for PostgreSQL, Google Cloud SQL, DigitalOcean Managed Databases
          - Self-hosted PostgreSQL instances
        - **Redis**: Compatible with your existing Redis infrastructure
          - Managed services: AWS ElastiCache, Azure Cache for Redis, Google Cloud Memorystore, Redis Cloud
          - Self-hosted Redis instances

        Both backends provide identical CyborgDB functionality and performance.

        <Note>Make sure you have your chosen database running and accessible before proceeding.</Note>
    </Step>

    <Step title="Install CyborgDB Service">
        Install the CyborgDB service package using conda and pip:

        <CodeGroup>
        ```bash Conda Environment (Recommended)
        # Create conda environment
        conda create -n cyborgdb-service python=3.12
        conda activate cyborgdb-service

        # Install the service
        pip install cyborgdb-service
        ```

        ```bash Virtual Environment
        # Create a virtual environment
        python -m venv cyborgdb-env
        source cyborgdb-env/bin/activate

        # Install the service
        pip install cyborgdb-service
        ```

        ```bash System Python
        # Install directly (not recommended for production)
        pip install cyborgdb-service
        ```
        </CodeGroup>

        <Warning>Using conda or a virtual environment is strongly recommended to avoid dependency conflicts with other Python packages.</Warning>
    </Step>

    <Step title="Configure Environment Variables">
        Set the required environment variables for your database backend:

        <Tabs>
            <Tab title="PostgreSQL Backend">
                <CodeGroup>
                ```bash Linux/macOS
                export CYBORGDB_API_KEY=cyborg_your_api_key_here
                export CYBORGDB_DB_TYPE=postgres
                export CYBORGDB_CONNECTION_STRING="host=localhost port=5432 dbname=postgres user=postgres password=your_password"
                ```

                ```bash .env File
                # Create a .env file in your working directory
                CYBORGDB_API_KEY=cyborg_your_api_key_here
                CYBORGDB_DB_TYPE=postgres
                CYBORGDB_CONNECTION_STRING=host=localhost port=5432 dbname=postgres user=postgres password=your_password
                ```
                </CodeGroup>
            </Tab>
            
            <Tab title="Redis Backend">
                <CodeGroup>
                ```bash Linux/macOS
                export CYBORGDB_API_KEY=cyborg_your_api_key_here
                export CYBORGDB_DB_TYPE=redis
                export CYBORGDB_CONNECTION_STRING="host=localhost,port=6379,db=0"
                ```

                ```bash .env File
                # Create a .env file in your working directory
                CYBORGDB_API_KEY=cyborg_your_api_key_here
                CYBORGDB_DB_TYPE=redis
                CYBORGDB_CONNECTION_STRING=host=localhost,port=6379,db=0
                ```
                </CodeGroup>
            </Tab>
        </Tabs>

        <Tip>Using a `.env` file is the most convenient method as it persists your configuration and keeps sensitive data out of your shell history.</Tip>
    </Step>

    <Step title="Start the Service">
        Run the CyborgDB service using the installed command:

        ```bash
        cyborgdb-service
        ```

        The service will start and display startup information including:
        - Database connection status
        - Server URL (default: `http://localhost:8000`)
        - Available API endpoints

        <Note>For additional configuration options, run `cyborgdb-service --help` to see all available command-line arguments and connection string examples.</Note>
    </Step>

    <Step title="Verify Installation">
        Once the service is running, verify it's working correctly:

        **Health Check:**
        ```bash
        curl http://localhost:8000/v1/health
        ```

        **API Documentation:**
        Navigate to [http://localhost:8000/docs](http://localhost:8000/docs) to explore the interactive API documentation.

        You should see a response indicating the service is healthy and ready to accept requests.
    </Step>

    <Step title="Advanced Configuration">
        For production deployments, consider these additional configurations:

        <Tabs>
            <Tab title="Environment Variables">
                | Variable | Description | Required | Example |
                |----------|-------------|----------|---------|
                | `CYBORGDB_API_KEY` | Your CyborgDB API key | ✅ | `cyborg_abc123...` |
                | `CYBORGDB_DB_TYPE` | Database backend type | ✅ | `postgres` or `redis` |
                | `CYBORGDB_CONNECTION_STRING` | Database connection details | ✅ | See connection formats |
                | `CYBORGDB_VERSION` | Service version (optional) | ❌ | `0.11.1` |
                | `HOST` | Service host binding | ❌ | `0.0.0.0` |
                | `PORT` | Service port | ❌ | `8000` |
            </Tab>

            <Tab title="Production Deployment">
                For production environments, consider using a process manager:

                ```bash
                # Using gunicorn (install separately)
                pip install gunicorn
                gunicorn cyborgdb_service.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000

                # Using systemd service (Linux)
                sudo systemctl enable cyborgdb-service
                sudo systemctl start cyborgdb-service
                ```
            </Tab>
        </Tabs>
    </Step>

| **Dependencies** | Managed by pip/conda | Bundled in container |
| **Resource Usage** | Lower overhead | Higher overhead |
| **Environment Isolation** | Python virtualenv | Container isolation |
| **Deployment Complexity** | Simple Python deployment | Container orchestration |
| **Configuration** | Environment variables/files | Environment variables |
| **Best For** | Development, Python-heavy workflows | Production, cloud deployment |

<Tip>Both approaches provide identical CyborgDB functionality. Choose based on your deployment preferences and infrastructure requirements.</Tip>
