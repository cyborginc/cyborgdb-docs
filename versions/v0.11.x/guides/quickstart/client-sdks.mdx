**CyborgDB** provides client SDKs for Python, JavaScript, and TypeScript, allowing you to interact with encrypted indexes from a variety of environments. Whether you're building server-side applications or deploying to the browser, the SDKs offer a simple, consistent interface for secure vector operations.

## Supported Languages
**Python**
- Use the Python SDK to add items, query encrypted indexes, and manage metadata in secure environments. Ideal for server-side workflows, research pipelines, or integration with LangChain and LlamaIndex.

**JavaScript / TypeScript**
- The JS/TS SDK supports both Node.js and browser environments. It enables frontend or edge-based applications to query CyborgDB directly. The SDK includes native LangChain support and is available via npm.
