**CyborgDB** can be deployed as a standalone microservice using Docker. This allows you to run a fully self-contained encrypted vector search service on your own infrastructure with minimal setup. The service exposes a REST API for integration with any stack.

## Overview
The Docker service is ideal for teams looking to self-host CyborgDB in cloud, on-prem, or containerized environments. It supports encrypted index operations, API key authentication, and concurrent access out of the box.

## Getting Started
To run the service locally:

ADD CODE

## Use Cases
- Deploying CyborgDB to cloud-native or on-prem environments
- Integrating with client applications via REST
- Supporting secure workloads without embedding CyborgDB directly in your app
- Running concurrent queries and managing indexes from external services
