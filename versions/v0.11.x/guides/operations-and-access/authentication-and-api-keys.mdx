title: "Authentication and API Keys"
---

All access to **CyborgDB** requires authentication using API keys. These keys allow you to securely interact with the CyborgDB service through the SDKs and REST API.

This guide covers how to generate, use, and manage your API keys from the [CyborgDB Admin Dashboard](https://cyborgdb.co/).

## Generating an API Key
  1. Go to the [CyborgDB Admin Dashboard](https://cyborgdb.co/)
  2. Log in with your account
  3. Navigate to the API Keys section
  4. Click Create API Key
  5. Enter a name for your key (e.g. `dev-key`, `prod-key`)
  6. Copy the key and store it securely (**You will not be able to view it again**)

Each key is tied to your account and can be used across environments unless revoked.

## Managing API Keys
From the Admin Dashboard, you can:
- View all active keys
- Revoke keys that are no longer needed
- Generate new keys at any time

Changes take effect immediately. Revoking a key will prevent any further access from that key.

## Best Practices
- Use separate keys for development, staging, and production
- Rotate keys regularly to reduce risk
- Revoke unused or compromised keys promptly
- Avoid hardcoding keys in frontend or public codebases
