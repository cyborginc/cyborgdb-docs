title: "Usage Tracking and Telemetry"
---

**CyborgDB** collects minimal telemetry data to support usage monitoring, billing, and system reliability. This page outlines what data is tracked, how itâ€™s used, and how it aligns with our privacy principles.

## What We Track
CyborgDB records basic operation counts for your account. This includes:
- Number of **queries**, **adds**, and **deletes** per index
- API key-level usage for tracking access patterns
- Aggregated usage volume over time (e.g. per day or per billing cycle)

This data powers the Usage and Billing sections of the [Admin Dashboard](https://cyborgdb.co/), helping you monitor activity and understand consumption.

## What We Don't Track
We do **NOT** log or store:
- Raw query text
- Item content or vectors
- Index names or metadata
- Personally identifiable information (PII)

CyborgDB is designed for confidential workloads. All indexing and query operations are encrypted, and telemetry is limited strictly to operation counts for billing and observability.

## Privacy Compliance

Our telemetry implementation complies with our published [Privacy Policy](https://www.cyborg.co/privacy-policy). It ensures:
- No access to sensitive data
- No retention of application-level content
- Transparent and minimal logging focused only on operational metrics
