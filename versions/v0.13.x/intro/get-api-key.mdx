    </Warning>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Generate Your API Key">

    <Warning>
    **Important**: Copy your API key immediately and store it securely. For security reasons, you won't be able to see the full key again after leaving this page.
    </Warning>
    
    **Best Practices:**
    - Store your API key in environment variables, not in your code
    - Never commit API keys to version control
    - Use different keys for development and production environments
    - Rotate keys regularly for enhanced security
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Using Your API Key

Once you have your API key, you can use it with any CyborgDB deployment:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Environment Variable (Recommended)">
    Set your API key as an environment variable:
    
    ```bash
    export CYBORGDB_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"
    ```
    
    Then reference it in your code:
    
    ```python
    import os
    from cyborgdb_core import Client
    
    client = Client(api_key=os.getenv("CYBORGDB_API_KEY"))
    ```
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Direct Usage">
    Use your API key directly in your code (not recommended for production):
    
    ```python
    from cyborgdb_core import Client
    
    client = Client(api_key="your-api-key-here")
    ```
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Configuration File">
    Store in a configuration file that's excluded from version control:
    
    ```python
    # config.py (add to .gitignore)
    CYBORGDB_API_KEY = "your-api-key-here"
    
    # main.py
    from config import CYBORGDB_API_KEY
    from cyborgdb_core import Client
    
    client = Client(api_key=CYBORGDB_API_KEY)
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>
