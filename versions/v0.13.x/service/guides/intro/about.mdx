### API Key Limitations

<Note>
**Free API Key Users**: If you're using a free API key, CyborgDB Service will have 1M item limit per index.

Upgrade to a [paid plan](https://www.cyborg.co/pricing) to unlock `cyborgdb-core` with unlimited vectors, all backing stores, GPU acceleration, and full performance capabilities.
</Note>

## Architecture Overview

CyborgDB Service runs as a containerized microservice in your infrastructure:

```mermaid
flowchart TB
  subgraph Your_Applications [Your Application]
    PythonSDK("Python SDK")
    JSSDK("JavaScript SDK")
    TSSDK("TypeScript SDK")
    GoSDK("Go SDK")
  end

  PythonSDK --> RESTAPI
  JSSDK --> RESTAPI
  TSSDK --> RESTAPI
  GoSDK --> RESTAPI

  RESTAPI("REST API")
  RESTAPI --> CyborgDB("CyborgDB Service")

  CyborgDB --> PostgreSQL
  CyborgDB --> Redis
  CyborgDB --> Memory

  PostgreSQL("PostgreSQL")
  Redis("Redis")
  Memory("Memory")
```


**Key Benefits:**
- Language-agnostic API access
- Horizontal scaling capabilities
- Operational monitoring and logging
- Production-ready deployment patterns

## When to Use Service vs Embedded

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Choose CyborgDB Service">
    - **Multi-language teams** - Need to support different programming languages
    - **Microservice architecture** - Want to separate vector operations from application logic
    - **Operational simplicity** - Prefer service-based deployment patterns
    - **Horizontal scaling** - Need to scale vector operations independently
    - **Team collaboration** - Multiple teams need access to the same vector data
    - **REST API preference** - Want standard HTTP endpoints for integration
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Consider CyborgDB Embedded">
    - **Maximum performance** - Need sub-millisecond latency with zero network overhead
    - **Single-language environment** - Python or C++ applications exclusively
    - **Air-gapped deployment** - No network access between components allowed
    - **Custom integration** - Require deep integration with existing systems
    - **Resource optimization** - Want to eliminate network serialization overhead
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Production Considerations

### Scaling and Performance
- **Horizontal Scaling**: Deploy multiple service instances behind a load balancer
- **Connection Pooling**: Configure database connections for high concurrency
- **Caching**: Use Redis backing store for low-latency workloads
- **Monitoring**: Enable telemetry and monitoring for production visibility

### Security
- **API Key Management**: Rotate keys regularly and use environment variables
- **Network Security**: Deploy within private networks or use TLS/SSL
- **Database Security**: Secure backing store connections and credentials
- **Access Control**: Implement proper authentication and authorization
