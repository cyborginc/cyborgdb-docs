Trains the encrypted index to optimize it for efficient similarity search queries. Training is essential for IVF-based indexes to achieve optimal query performance and accuracy.

<Tip>In CyborgDB Service, training is typically handled automatically by the service. However, you can explicitly trigger training once enough vectors have been added.</Tip>

```python
index.train(
    n_lists=None,
    batch_size=None,
    max_iters=None,
    tolerance=None
)
```

### Parameters
| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
|-----------|------|---------|-------------|
| `n_lists` | `int` | `None` | _(Optional)_ Number of inverted lists to use for the index. When `None`, auto-selects based on the dataset size |
| `batch_size` | `int` | `None` | _(Optional)_ Number of vectors to process per training batch. When `None`, the server uses 2048 |
| `max_iters` | `int` | `None` | _(Optional)_ Maximum number of training iterations. When `None`, the server uses 100 |
| `tolerance` | `float` | `None` | _(Optional)_ Convergence tolerance for training completion. When `None`, the server uses 1e-6 |

<Note>Training is a compute-intensive operation that may take several seconds to minutes depending on the index size and configuration.</Note>

### Returns

`None`

### Exceptions

<AccordionGroup>
    <Accordion title="Error">
        - Throws if the API request fails due to network connectivity issues.
        - Throws if authentication fails (invalid API key).
        - Throws if the encryption key is invalid for the specified index.
        - Throws if there are insufficient resources to complete training.
    </Accordion>
    <Accordion title="Training Errors">
        - Throws if the index has no vectors to train on.
        - Throws if the index configuration is incompatible with training.
        - Throws if training parameters are out of valid ranges.
        - Throws if training fails to converge within the specified parameters.
    </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Example Usage

#### Basic Index Training

```python
# Train the index after adding the data
index.train()
```

#### Custom Training Parameters

```python
# Train with custom parameters for large dataset
index.train(
    n_lists=100,        # Number of inverted lists
    batch_size=4096,    # Larger batches for better performance
    max_iters=200,      # More iterations for better convergence
    tolerance=1e-7      # Stricter convergence criteria
)
```
