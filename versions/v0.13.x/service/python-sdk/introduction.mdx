The **CyborgDB** Python SDK provides a high-level interface for working with encrypted indexes in Python applications. It supports core operations such as creating indexes, adding data, querying, and managing metadata. The SDK is compatible with LangChain and works with both local and remote deployments.

The package is available on [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/cyborgdb/) and the source code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/cyborginc/cyborgdb-py).

## Installation

```bash
pip install cyborgdb
```

## Prerequisites

Before using the CyborgDB Python SDK, you need to have the CyborgDB service running:

```bash
# Install the CyborgDB service
pip install cyborgdb-service

# Or pull the Docker image
docker pull cyborginc/cyborgdb-service

# Start the service
cyborgdb-service

# Or run the Docker container
docker run -p 8000:8000 cyborginc/cyborgdb-service
```

For detailed service setup instructions, see our quickstart guides for [Docker](../guides/intro/quickstart-docker) and [Python](../guides/intro/quickstart-python).
