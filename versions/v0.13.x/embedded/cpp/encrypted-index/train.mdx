title: "Train Index"
mode: "wide"
---

Builds the index using the specified training configuration. Required before efficient querying.
Prior to calling this, all queries will be conducted using encrypted exhaustive search.
After, they will be conducted using encrypted ANN search.

```cpp
void TrainIndex(const TrainingConfig& training_config = TrainingConfig());
```

### Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|----------|------------|--------------------|
| `training_config` | [`TrainingConfig`](../types#trainingconfig) | _(Optional)_ Training parameters including n_lists, batch size, max iterations, tolerance, and max memory. |

<Tip>There must be at least `2 * n_lists` or `10,000` (whichever is greater) vector embeddings in the index prior to calling this function. The `n_lists` parameter is configured within the `TrainingConfig` object.</Tip>

### Exceptions

Throws if there are not enough vector embeddings in the index for training (must be at least `2 * n_lists`).

### Example Usage

```cpp
// TrainingConfig(n_lists, batch_size, max_iters, tolerance, max_memory)
cyborg::TrainingConfig config(1024, 2048, 100, 1e-6, 0);
index->TrainIndex(config);
```
