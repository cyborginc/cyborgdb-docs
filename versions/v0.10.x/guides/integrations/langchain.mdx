**CyborgDB** has a LangChain integration that allows you to use CyborgDB as a vector store in your LangChain applications. This integration is available for both `cyborgdb-core` and `cyborgdb-lite`.

The integration is available in the `cyborgdb_core.integration.langchain` and `cyborgdb_lite.integration.langchain` modules, respectively.

## Installation

To install CyborgDB with LangChain support, you must install either `cyborgdb-core` or `cyborgdb-lite` with the `langchain` extra. You can do this using pip:

```bash
# For cyborgdb-core
pip install cyborgdb-core[langchain]

# For cyborgdb-lite
pip install cyborgdb-lite[langchain]
```

This will install the necessary dependencies for the LangChain integration.

## Usage

To use CyborgDB with LangChain, you can import the `CyborgVectorStore` class from the `cyborgdb_core.integration.langchain` or `cyborgdb_lite.integration.langchain` module, depending on which version you are using.

```python
from cyborgdb_core.integration.langchain import CyborgVectorStore
# or
from cyborgdb_lite.integration.langchain import CyborgVectorStore
```

You can then create a `CyborgVectorStore` instance and use it as a vector store in your LangChain applications.
