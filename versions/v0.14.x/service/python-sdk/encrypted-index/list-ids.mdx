### Example Usage

all_ids = index.list_ids()
print(f"Total items in index: {len(all_ids)}")

# Print first 10 IDs
for id in all_ids[:10]:
    print(f"ID: {id}")

# Check if a specific ID exists
target_id = "document_123"
if target_id in all_ids:
    print(f"Document {target_id} exists in the index")
else:
    print(f"Document {target_id} not found")

# Use for batch processing
batch_size = 100
for i in range(0, len(all_ids), batch_size):
    batch_ids = all_ids[i:i+batch_size]
    # Process batch of documents
    items = index.get(batch_ids)
    # ... process items ...
