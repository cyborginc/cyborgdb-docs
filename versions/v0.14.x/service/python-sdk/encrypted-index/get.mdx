Retrieves vectors from the encrypted index by their IDs, with options to specify which fields to include in the results.

```python
index.get(ids, include=["vector", "contents", "metadata"])
```

### Parameters
| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
|-----------|------|---------|-------------|
| `ids` | `List[str]` | - | List of vector IDs to retrieve |
| `include` | `List[str]` | `["vector", "contents", "metadata"]` | Fields to include in the response |

### Returns

`List[Dict]` - List of dictionaries containing the requested vector data.

```python
[
  {
    "id": str, # Vector identifier (always included)
    "vector": List[float], # Vector data (if included)
    "contents": str | bytes, # Vector contents (if included, returned as string or bytes depending on how it was stored)
    "metadata": Dict # Vector metadata (if included)
  },
  ...
]
```

<Tip>The `contents` field is returned in its original format (string or bytes) as it was stored. String contents remain strings, and bytes contents remain bytes after decryption.</Tip>

### Exceptions

    <Accordion title="Error">
        - Throws if the API request fails due to network connectivity issues.
        - Throws if authentication fails (invalid API key).
        - Throws if the encryption key is invalid for the specified index.
        - Throws if there are internal server errors preventing the retrieval.
    </Accordion>
    <Accordion title="Validation Errors">
        - Throws if the `ids` parameter is null, undefined, or empty.
        - Throws if the `include` parameter contains invalid field names.
    </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Example Usage

```python
# Get vectors with all data
vector_ids = ['doc1', 'doc2', 'doc3']
results = index.get(vector_ids)

for item in results:
    print(f"ID: {item['id']}")
    print(f"Vector: {item['vector'][:5]}...")  # Show first 5 dimensions
    print(f"Content: {item.get('contents', 'N/A')}")
    print("---")
```
