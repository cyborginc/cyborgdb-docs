The **CyborgDB** JavaScript and TypeScript SDK allows you to securely interact with encrypted indexes from both Node.js and browser environments. It supports all core operations including index creation, data insertion, and encrypted querying.

The SDK provides comprehensive TypeScript support with strongly-typed interfaces, improved type safety, and utility functions for working with JSON metadata and error handling.

The package is available on [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cyborgdb) and the source code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/cyborginc/cyborgdb-js).

## Installation

```bash
npm install cyborgdb
```

## Prerequisites

Before using the CyborgDB JavaScript/TypeScript SDK, you need to have the CyborgDB service running:

```bash
# Install the CyborgDB service
pip install cyborgdb-service

# Or pull the Docker image
docker pull cyborginc/cyborgdb-service

# Start the service
cyborgdb-service

# Or run the Docker container
docker run -p 8000:8000 cyborginc/cyborgdb-service
```

For detailed service setup instructions, see our quickstart guides for [Docker](../guides/intro/quickstart-docker) and [Python](../guides/intro/quickstart-python).
