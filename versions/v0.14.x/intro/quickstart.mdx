Get started with CyborgDB in minutes! This guide will help you choose the right deployment model and get your first confidential vector search running quickly.

## Choose Your Deployment Path

CyborgDB offers two main deployment approaches - both **self-hosted** on your infrastructure:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="CyborgDB Service" href="../service/guides/intro/quickstart-python" icon="cloud">
    *Self-deployed REST API service*
    
    Deploy as a microservice with REST API and client SDKs. Best for:
    - Multi-language team environments
    - Independent scaling capabilities
    - Operational simplicity with centralized management
    - Microservice architecture patterns
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="CyborgDB Embedded" href="../embedded/guides/intro/quickstart" icon="code">
    *Direct library integration*
    
    Embed directly in your applications using Python/C++ libraries. Best for:
    - Maximum performance and control
    - Custom integrations and workflows
    - Single-application deployments
    - Sub-millisecond latency requirements
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Framework Integrations

Already using AI frameworks? Get started even faster with our native integrations:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="LangChain Integration" href="../integrations/langchain/introduction" icon="link">
    *Drop-in replacement for existing vector stores*
    
    Replace your current vector store with CyborgDB's encrypted alternative:
    ```python
    from cyborgdb_core.integrations.langchain import CyborgVectorStore
    
    store = CyborgVectorStore.from_texts(
        texts=["hello world", "goodbye world"],
        embedding="all-MiniLM-L6-v2",
        index_key=CyborgVectorStore.generate_key(save=True),
        # ... other config
    )
    ```
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="More Integrations Coming" href="../integrations/about" icon="plus">
    *Expanding framework support*
    
    We're actively building integrations for:
    - LlamaIndex
    - Haystack  
    - Semantic Kernel
    - Custom frameworks

## Quick Decision Guide

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="I want to get started quickly">
    **Fastest path to working confidential vector search**
    
    → Use [**CyborgDB Service**](../service/guides/intro/quickstart-python) with Python SDK
    
    Deploy as a microservice and connect via REST API. Minimal setup required.
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="I have a LangChain application">
    **Drop-in replacement for existing vector stores**
    
    → Use the [**LangChain Integration**](../integrations/langchain/introduction) guide
    
    Replace your existing vector store with just a few lines of code changes.
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="I need maximum performance">
    **Sub-millisecond latency requirements**
    
    → Use [**CyborgDB Embedded**](../embedded/guides/intro/quickstart) libraries
    
    Direct integration eliminates network overhead for ultimate performance.
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="I'm building a distributed application">
    **Multi-language team or microservice architecture**
    
    → Use [**CyborgDB Service**](../service/guides/intro/quickstart-python) deployment
    
    One service supports Python, JavaScript, Go, and C++ client SDKs.
